<div class="bio-section">
    <h2 class="section-heading">BIO</h2>
    <p>My journey into the world of IT started when I was introduced to the subject in Grade 9. I quickly developed an interest in everything we did in that class, and it became clear to me that technology was something I enjoyed and wanted to pursue further. This led me to study IT at City of Malabon University, where I am currently working on projects that test and refine my skills in coding and web development.</p>
    <p> &nbsp; </p>
    <p>I am particularly passionate about web development, where I can use my creativity and technical skills to create functional and user-friendly websites. Although I am not involved in extracurricular activities, my skills are continuously tested and developed through the coding tasks and projects that I work on in school. These projects push me to learn new things and apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.</p>
    <p> &nbsp; </p>
    <p>I am still a student, but I am already driven by the challenges that come with solving problems, collaborating with others, and constantly innovating in the field of web development. These values guide my approach to every project I take on and shape my goals for the future.</p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Technical Skills:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Passionate about building websites, I have developed skills in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve also worked with back-end technologies like Node.js and Express, which I’ve used in projects like the quiz app and other web-based tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> I am proficient in managing databases using MySQL, demonstrated through projects that involve handling data, such as scheduling systems and ticket tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting:</strong> I excel at identifying problems and finding solutions, a skill I’ve developed through working on various coding projects and network configuration exercises (such as those in Cisco Packet Tracer).</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> I focus on creating web applications that are not only functional but also responsive, ensuring they work well on different devices and screen sizes, using frameworks like Bootstrap.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> &nbsp; </p>

    <h3 class="subheading">Soft Skills:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I work well in teams, especially on school projects, where I contribute to different aspects, from coding to troubleshooting and improving user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> I can clearly explain technical concepts, ensuring that ideas are accessible to both technical and non-technical team members. Whether it’s explaining how a dynamic scoring system works in my quiz app or communicating project goals, I value clear, effective communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptability and Learning:</strong> As a student, I’m always learning and adapting to new challenges. I stay flexible, whether tackling a new programming language or applying my skills to new types of projects, and I’m constantly seeking to improve.</li>
