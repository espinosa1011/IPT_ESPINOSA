                    <p>This is one of my early projects, and I'm proud of how it turned out. 
                        The website we created showcases all the important information about Barangay 
                        NBBS Dagat-Dagatan, including its history, geography, and COVID cases. 
                        Along with my team members Vincent Barcelon, Kim Basada, Roel Dolendo, 
                        Mark Lusanta, and Vincent Tayson, we came together as a group called Roborats 
                        to develop this site. The purpose behind this project was to provide a detailed 
                        and accessible resource for people to learn more about our community, especially 
                        during a time when staying informed about local matters, like the impact of COVID-19, 
                        is so crucial. We wanted to make sure that the history and geographical significance 
                        of Barangay NBBS Dagat-Dagatan were well-represented as well, so everyone can 
                        appreciate and understand more about our local area.</p>

                    <h2>Additional Info</h2>
                    <p>This was one of my early projects, and I really enjoyed working on it. The website 
                        we created is all about Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. It features 
                        chapter summaries, details about the characters, and information about the author, 
                        Ransom Riggs. We also included a section that highlights other books written by him. 
                        Along with my teammates Vincent, Kim, Roel, Mark, and Tayson, we made this website 
                        as part of our group, Roborats. Our goal for this project was to provide a thorough 
                        exploration of the book for its readers, offering insights into the characters and 
                        the author’s other works. We wanted to create a helpful resource for fans of the book, 
                        making it easier for them to dive deeper into the story. It was a great opportunity to 
                        blend our passion for literature with web development.</p>

                    <p>This was one of the hardest projects I've worked on, but also one of the most rewarding. 
                        The website we built records tickets and stores the data in MySQL, which required a lot 
                        of attention to detail and careful planning. Along with my teammates Nicole, Arianne, 
                        Princess, Athena, Lyca, and Ella, we made this website as part of our group, Anita Max Wynn. 
                        The goal of this project was to create a functional ticketing system that could manage and 
                        store data efficiently. We did this to help streamline processes and make it easier to track 
                        tickets. It was a great learning experience for all of us, combining technical skills with 
                        problem-solving, and we were able to achieve something that we could all be proud of.</p>

                    <p>This was an enjoyable project to work on. I created a quiz website with Elton Jeff Tusi, 
                        and the category was entertainment: cartoons. The website allows users to take a fun quiz 
                        and displays their score at the end. We also included a section that shows the history of 
                        cartoons, offering a bit of background to make the experience more engaging. The purpose 
                        of this project was to create an interactive and educational way for people to test their 
                        knowledge of cartoons, while also learning more about their history. It was a great 
                        opportunity to combine our interest in entertainment with web development.</p>

                        Nicole, Arianne, Princess, and Athena, we're working on a system to record all the information 
                        of doctors and their schedules as administrators of Evergreen General Hospital. The goal of 
                        this project is to create a more organized and efficient way for the hospital to manage doctor 
                        schedules, ensuring that everything runs smoothly for both staff and patients. We wanted to help 
                        improve the hospital's administrative processes, making it easier for everyone to access and 
                        update important information quickly. This project is an excellent way for us to apply our skills 
                        while contributing to a real-world solution.</p>
