                    Welcome to my portfolio website! Here, you’ll find more about my personal projects and interests. 
                    I’m a student at City of Malabon University, currently exploring different IT projects, like setting up 
                    network scenarios in Cisco Packet Tracer and coding with Node.js and Express.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my portfolio, you’ll see some of my completed projects, ongoing work, and experiments in IT, 
                    including network configurations, web applications, and other innovative solutions. I aim to showcase 
                    not only my technical abilities but also my creativity and problem-solving skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m passionate about applying what I learn to real-world scenarios and always eager to improve my skills. 
                    Outside of school, I love playing online games like League of Legends and Valorant, as well as playing the guitar.
                </p>
